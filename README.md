Assignment 1 Introduction

Problem 1: Getting to know Python
  set up Python-3.8 using Miniconda and install needed packages. (i) Pillow for loading and saving images; (ii) NumPy and SciPy for scientific computing; and (iii) Matplotlib for plotting and visualisation and as an alternative for loading and saving images.
  
Problem 2: Bayer Interpolation 
  Separate the color channels filling missing values with zero,uses bilinear interpolation to restore all missing RGB color values.
  
Problem 3: Projective Transformation
  a camera is simulated to allow a specific visualization of a 3D scene as a 2D image, and then start with the obtained 2D points and some other information to restore the original 3D coordinates ofall points.

Problem 4: Image Filtering and Edge Detection
  compute image derivatives and create a simple edge detector with non-maximum suppression

Assignment 2 Image Pyramids and PCA

Problem 1:Image Pyramids and Image Sharpening
  create a small sharpening application by using both Gaussian and Laplacian image pyramids
  
Problem 2:PCA on Face Images
  working with a training database of human face images and build a low-dimensional model of the face appearance using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Assignment 3 Interest points detection and image stitching

Problem 1: Hessian Detector
  interest point detection with Hessian operator
  
Problem 2: Image Stitching
  use RANSAC to estimate the homography matrix based on SIFT point correspondences in both images.

Assignment 4

Problem 1: Eight-point algorithm
  use the Eight-point algorithm to compute the fundamental matrix between two images.
  
Problem 2: Estimating Optical Flow
  estimate optical flow (OF) using the Lucas-Kanade method and  the iterative coarse-to-fine strategy

Bonus Assignment  Neural Networks

  design a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify bike and plane images, implement forward and backward propagation for the neural network
